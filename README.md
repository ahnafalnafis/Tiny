# Tiny

This is a simple bot which is made with Python. It can't do a lot of stuff. Some sorts of thing can be done by it like opening urls in browser, opening apps, executing some system commands, etc. For now I'm keeping it as a chatbot, in the future I'll make it more usable by adding voice feature and so on.

## Installation

These command will install tiny in the `~/tiny` dir

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ahnafalnafis/tiny.git
cd tiny
python install.py
```

You can change the installation path by specifying the custom path with `--dir "path/to/dir"` parameter -

```bash
python install.py --dir "path/to/dir"
```

Finally, add the path of Tiny where you installed it into PATH/Environment variables. If you're in Windows, reboot your computer after adding the path into Environment variables.
